<br/>
(Capo 3)
<br/>
Verse:  Am   G
<br/>
I remember\
Better days\
When I was young\
And all I did was play\
<br/>
Now my mind\
Is lost in the haze\
And all those memories\
Are starting to fade\
<br/>
It all just seems\
Like such a waste\
Like a young girl\
Who’s given up the chaste\
<br/>
I don’t mean\
To overstate\
It’s just the hour\
Is getting late\
<br/>
Chorus:  F  Am  G
<br/>
Now I just want to run\
Run away to the place where I am from\
That time and space where I could become\
Anyone\
<br/>
What have I become?\
A cartoon\
Of what I once was?\
What have I become?\
What have I become?\
<br/>
Chorus:  F  Am  G
<br/>
Now I just want to run\
Run away to the place where I am from\
That time and space where I could become\
Anyone\
<br/>
What have I become?
<br/>
What have I become?
<br/>
