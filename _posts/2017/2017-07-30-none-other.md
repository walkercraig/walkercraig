Verse:  C  F  Am  F
<br/>
I’ never met another one like me\
Another one with my heart beat\
Another one who’ seen the things I’ seen\
Another one who dreams the dreams I’ dream\
<br/>
And it’s all right (8x extended)
<br/>
<br/>
I'll climb the mountains and cross the seas\
I’ll be somethin’ or nothin’ it don’t matter to me\
No matter where this journey leads\
It’ll be mine and I’ll be free\
<br/>
Chorus: F  C  Am  D
<br/>
‘Cause I know I’m go’n’ find my way\
If it takes me forever and a day\
Wherever I may roam, wherever I may lay\
I know it’ll be in my own way\
<br/>
Verse:  C  F  Am  F
<br/>
I'll brave the storms and face the heat\
Dance with fate and never miss a beat\
See the world from a lonely seat\
As long as my dream's inside of me\
<br/>
Chorus: F  C  Am  D
<br/>
‘Cause I know I’m go’n’ find my way\
If it takes me forever and a day\
Wherever I may roam, wherever I may lay\
I know it’ll be in my own way\
<br/>
