(Capo 3)

Verse:  Am   G

I remember
Better days
When I was young
And all I did was play

Now my mind
Is lost in the haze
And all those memories
Are starting to fade

It all just seems
Like such a waste
Like a young girl
Who’s given up the chaste

I don’t mean
To overstate
It’s just the hour
Is getting late

Chorus:  F  Am  G
Now I just want to run
Run away to the place where I am from
That time and space where I could become
Anyone 

What have I become?
A cartoon
Of what I once was?
What have I become?
What have I become?

Chorus:  F  Am  G
Now I just want to run
Run away to the place where I am from
That time and space where I could become
Anyone 

What have I become?

What have I become?
