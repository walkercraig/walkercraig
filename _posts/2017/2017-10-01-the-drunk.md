Verse 1

I think I had too much to drink

Because I’m beginning to think

A little too much about the past

Like this glass here in front of me

I never realize until it’s empty

That nothing good ever lasts

Just here, spinning round on this carousel

Waiting on heaven, or waiting on hell

Waiting for the same damn thing as everyone else

Adieu, bon voyage, fare thee well


I guess

I just can’t get enough


Verse 2

Bartender, pour me something strong

So I can’t remember just where it all went wrong

When I was a younger man

And please, please play my favorite song

I promise it isn’t too long

Tonight all that damn jukebox has played are Saint Valentine shams

Ah, forget it...fill up my glass again!

Have another drink with me, my friend

Let’s toast to living and living free

See, my glass represents all eternity

Fill it up again as soon as it’s empty

Just make sure you wash away all that memory


(improvise)
And on

And on and on and on it goes

And on and on and on and on it goes

And on and on and on and on it goes

And on and on and on and on

And on and on and on and on

And on and on and on and on

And on


Verse 3

Bartender, you’ve got all my money

Please, please, please have mercy on me

And fill my glass until my mind reaches the sublime

I promise you’ll never see me again

I’ll disappear into the night like some great magician

And I’ll never come back until that clock strikes thirteen times

Magic? That’s something I happen to know

I learned from an old man on the side of the road

Somewhere in the middle of the night on Highway Ninety‑Four

What…

What was I just talking about?

Where was I? Oh yeah, can’t seem to figure out

Why I’ve spent so much time trying to find the easy route

Man, all the pretty girls are out tonight

I think if I play my cards right

That one there, with the red hair, might take me home
