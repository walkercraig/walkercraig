Whole:  C  F  (vary tempo and dynamics)
<br/>
I think I had too much to drink\
Because I’m beginning to think\
A little too much about the past\
Like this glass here in front of me\
I never realize until it’s empty\
That nothin’ good ever lasts\
Just here, spinnin’ ‘round on this carousel\
Waitin on heaven, or waitin on hell\
Waitin for the same damn thing as everyone else\
Adieu, bon voya’, fare t’e’ well\
<br/>
I guess I just can’t get enough (repeat until satisfied)
<br/>
Bartender! Pour me sumthin’ straawng!\
So I cant remember jus’ whare itall went wrong\
When I was a younga man\
An’ please…please play my favorite song\
I promise it ayn’t toooo long\
Tonigh’ all that damn jukeboks has played are Saynt Valentyne shams\
Ahh fuck it…Fill up my glass again!\
Have another drink with me my frien’\
Let’s toast to livin’ and livin’ free\
See my glass…repreessents all æternity\
Fillitup ag’in soon as it’s emptey\
Just make sure you wash away all that memorey\
<br/>
(improvise)
<br/>
And on\
And on andonand on it goes\
And on and onandonandon it go’\
And on andonandonandon it goes\
And on andonandonandon\
And on and on andonandon\
Andon and on and on and on\
And on\
<br/>
Bartender! You’s gah alla my money!\
Please please pleeease have mersey on meee\
An’ fill my glass until my mind reaches the sublime\
I promise…you’ll ne’er see mee agaen\
I’ll dissappear intothe nite like some great magician\
And I’ll nevah come back until that clokk strike thirteen times\
Magic…that’s some’in’ I haappen to know\
I learne’ from an ol’ man on the syde of the road\
Somewhere in the mi’le of the night on hiway ninety fo’’\
Man…all the pretty girls are out tonight\
I think if I play my cards right\
That one there, with the red hair, might take me home\
Wut…\
What was I juss talkin’ abou’?\
Where was I? O’yah, can’t seem to figure out\
Whyyy I’ve spent soo much time tryin’ to fin’ the eeeasy route\
<br/>
(improvise)
