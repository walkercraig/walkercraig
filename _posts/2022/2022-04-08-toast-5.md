<br/>

Raise your glass of wine

And ignore the bad rhyme

As it's just an excuse in the way

But do not forget

Your eternal debt

And to keep the ugly at bay

And do not regret

A life of aesthete

Is always the best way to pray

So to yours and to mine

Across all space and time

Without whom we'd not be here today

<br/>
