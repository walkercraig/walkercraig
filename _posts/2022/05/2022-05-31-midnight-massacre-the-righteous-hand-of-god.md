title: Midnight Massacre, or The Righteous Hand of God
---

<br/>

Man knows bloodlust not

Until revealed

As he savors a midnight snack

And sees

In the dim light of the open refrigerator door

Cast across the kitchen floor

The true scope of the Black Army invading his lands under the cover of darkness

Their tiny shadows floating across the surface 

Not since Alexander

Not since Abd-Al-Rahman

Not since Napoleon, Barbarossa, nor Lucifer has such sin been so on parade

But with this

This like all the others

Cometh the fall

At once it rises

The genetic memory passed down through the ages

Man's greatest purpose

To provide and to protect

His wife will wake in the morn'

And not even the Wrath of God will cause man to flinch as does the thought of her reaction when she glimpse from the shores of the black river

How little their Ã¦rth

How small their place

How great their hubris

To believe

Perhaps as we believe

That we can tame this Great Mystery

That there be nothing

Neither above nor below

That can halt our long march to the stars

That they, too, will one day peek behind the curtain

One day lift the veil

One day know the unknowable and free ourselves from our eternal torment

Somewhere

Far, far away

Perhaps, but still

The decision was made long, long ago

Before he first crawled out of the slime

His choice is no more his than it is theirs

And it is in that moment he says a humble prayer and hopes that be enough

To save him from the horrors he will commit

For He is the Righteous Hand of God

The dam breaks
