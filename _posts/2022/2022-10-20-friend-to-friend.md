[Section Chords:  A  F#m]

Hey kid\
Take a break\
From the life you're\
Tryin' to make

Go on now\
It'll be okay\
I promise\
It can wait

[Section Chords:  E  F#m  D  A]

Too much of somethin’\
Can drive you insane\
It’s funny even too much lovin’\
Can be hard on the brain\
Now I’m not tryin’ to tell ya\
To run from the pain\
I’m just tryin’ to help ya\
Do your best to maintain 

[Section Chords:  G  D  A  A]

Because I know it never ends\
There’s always somethin’ round the bend\
From me to you, friend to friend\
Take some time, say an amen

Amen (choral repeat until satisfied)
