title: My Old Fashioned Guy

Everyone in Chicago has a guy for something and, after a brief break, in Craig's first column back he wanted to write about his Old Fashioned guy.

<p>I was feeling a little down the other day so I did what all good Chicagoans do when they're feeling a little down. What your ancestor's ancestor's ancestors did. I left work early and I stopped at a tavern for a drink because I needed a good place to think.</p>

<p>Taverns in Chicago are easy to find. They used to be a lot easier to find. It used to be that all you had to do was walk out a door, any door, turn to the right or to the left, didn't matter which, and walk to the corner.</p>

<p>There it was. A tavern.</p>
