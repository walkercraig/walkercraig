title: As Long As I Have Faith

*An excerpt from a song for my daughter.*

<br/>

On the long and lonesome journey

To the far and promised land

With a song and a story

All I carry in my hand

My little life is yours tonight

Your Peace is my command

For as long as songs and stories

Live in the hearts of Man

<br/>

As long as I have Faith

Oh I know I’ll find the way

And no matter where I lay

We’ll meet again someday

<br/>
