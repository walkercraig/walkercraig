title: As Long As I Have Faith

*An excerpt from a song I wrote for my daughter.*

<br/>

On the long and lonesome journey
To the far and promised land
With a song and a story
All I carry in my hand
My little life is yours tonight
Your Peace is my command
For as long as songs and stories
Live in the hearts of man

As long as I have Faith
Oh I know I’ll find the way
And no matter where I lay
We’ll meet again someday

<br/>
