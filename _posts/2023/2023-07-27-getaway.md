[VERSE 1]\
[CHORD PROGRESSION:  G  D  Em  C]\
We’ve been stuck in the same old town\
Dreams lifting us up and weighin' us down\
I got some money and gas in the car\
We can go anywhere and just follow the stars\
Billboards glow on the interstate\
Neon signs sayin' don’t hesitate\
Radio blastin’ as we cruise around\
This old Chevy’s never once let me down

[CHORUS]\
[CHORD PROGRESSION:  G  D  Em  C  G]\
Hey\
You wanna\
Getaway\
Tomorrow\
And become someone we never thought we would be\
I say\
We oughta\
Getaway\
Tomorrow\
There’s a life out there that’s made for you and me\
[CHORD PROGRESSION:  Am  C  G]\
We have everything that we could need\
Out there somewhere we just can't see\
And all we gotta do\
All we gotta do\
All we gotta do\
Is believe

[VERSE 2]\
[CHORD PROGRESSION:  G  D  Em  C]\
City skylines break through the haze\
Golden horizons over fields of maize\
Every mile flowin' deep in our veins\
With every turn it won't be the same\
Headlights fading into the night\
What we’re leaving feels so small in the light\
Whatever comes it'll all be fine\
We’ll write our story one day at a time

[CHORUS]\
[CHORD PROGRESSION:  G  D  Em  C  G]\
Hey\
You wanna\
Getaway\
Tomorrow\
And become someone we never thought we would be\
I say\
We oughta\
Getaway\
Tomorrow\
There’s a life out there that’s made for you and me\
[CHORD PROGRESSION:  Am  C  G]\
We have everything that we could need\
Out there somewhere we just can't see\
And all we gotta do\
All we gotta do\
All we gotta do\
Is believe

[BRIDGE]\
Don’t get me wrong\
The road will be dangerous\
But as long as we’re strong\
Nothin’ can stop us\
Maybe we’ll stumble, maybe we’ll fall\
But I’d rather chase it than not try at all\
No turning back, the future’s wide\
It's you and me, side by side

[CHORUS]\
[CHORD PROGRESSION:  G  D  Em  C  G]\
Hey\
You wanna\
Getaway\
Tomorrow\
And become someone we never thought we would be\
I say\
We oughta\
Getaway\
Tomorrow\
There’s a life out there that’s made for you and me\
[CHORD PROGRESSION:  Am  C  G]\
We have everything that we could need\
Out there somewhere we just can't see\
And all we gotta do\
All we gotta do\
All we gotta do\
Is believe
