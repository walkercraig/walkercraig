<br/>
It’s a simple kind of thing\
That makes me want to sing\
Like how the feel of a single kiss\
Can make me long for all those I missed\
Such a simple part of love\
That makes me look above\
And around for the unseen\
And makes being feel like a dream\
<br/>
I didn’t understand it\
Until I felt your hand in mine\
And it felt like someone planned it\
From before the dawn of time\
And if I could command it\
Oh I’d have you stay a while\
But I am just a simple man and\
A part of the grand design\
<br/>
And grateful for each moment that appears\
And thankful it’s you that I found here\
In this wonderful mysterious world\
That’s all so simple when a boy kisses a girl\
<br/>
