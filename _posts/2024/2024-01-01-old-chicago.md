G   C   G   C   G   Em   D   C   G

I’ve traveled far and wide
Out passed the Great Divide
And ‘round where the Angels reside

I’ve played the coastal plain
Sang on the shores of Maine
And sailed amber waves of grain

Laid down with Miss Zippi
Got down and washed my feet
In a clear purple mountain stream

I’ve seen the great temples and halls
Been struck with wonder and awe
And made to feel smaller than small

Pre-Chorus
C  G  Em  C  G
C  G  D
There’s no place I’d rather be
When God comes callin’ me
Than there by the sweetwater sea
Surrounded by memories

Chorus
C   G   Em   C   G
C   G   Em   G   D   C   G
I’m goin’ home
To old Chicago
Where my heart knows the rhythm and the rhyme
And it’ll be my home
That Old Chicago 
Until the end of time

Bridge



Chorus
