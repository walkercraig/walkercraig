Verse:  G   C   G   C   G   Em   D   C   G
<br/>
I’ve traveled far and wide\
Out passed the Great Divide\
And ‘round where the Angels reside\
<br/>
I’ve played the coastal plain\
Sang on the shores of Maine\
And sailed amber waves of grain\
<br/>
Pre-Chorus:  C  G  Em  C  G  C  G  D
<br/>
There’s no place I’d rather be\
When God comes callin’ me\
Than there by the sweetwater sea\
Surrounded by memories\
<br/>
Chorus: C   G   Em   C   G
<br/>
C   G   Em   G   D   C   G
<br/>
I’m goin’ home\
To old Chicago\
Where my heart knows the rhythm and the rhyme\
And it’ll be my home\
That Old Chicago\
Until the end of my time\
<br/>

Verse:  G   C   G   C   G   Em   D   C   G
<br/>
Laid down with Miss Zippi\
Got down and washed my feet\
In a clear purple mountain stream\
<br/>
I’ve seen the great temples and halls\
Been struck with wonder and awe\
And made to feel smaller than small\
<br/>
Pre-Chorus:  C  G  Em  C  G  C  G  D
<br/>
There’s no place I’d rather be\
When God comes callin’ me\
Than there by the sweetwater sea\
Surrounded by memories\
<br/>
Chorus: C   G   Em   C   G
<br/>
C   G   Em   G   D   C   G
<br/>
I’m goin’ home\
To old Chicago\
Where my heart knows the rhythm and the rhyme\
And it’ll be my home\
That Old Chicago\
Until the end of my time\
