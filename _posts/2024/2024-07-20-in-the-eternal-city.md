<br/>
Verse:  G   C   G   D
<br/>
In the eternal city, where the pavement shine\
And the street lamps all twinkle like diamonds in the sky\
There's a melody playing, in the silence of time\
Sung from father to father to father to mine\
<br/>
Oh, the song tells a story, of fortunes and fears\
Of cowards and courage, and smiles and tears\
Of a tale in a glance, a poem in a sigh\
And a toast in all glasses to the light in our eyes\
<br/>
Chorus:  C   G   Em  G   D
<br/>
Where the rivers they flow with the dreams in our minds\
To the sea where all wishes and myths combine\
Where the fine yarns are woven, where the magic spins\
The eternal city, where all streets begin\
<br/>
Verse:  G   C   G   D
<br/>
By the light of the tavern, where the spirits sing\
The laughter it echoes, and the walls they ring\
With a rhythm as old as the dawn and the spring\
And the tidings of all the good hope that they bring\
<br/>
Somewhere in the distance it whispers our name\
A call to the wanderers like the warmth of the flame\
No matter where from where no matter will be\
In the place where even our shadows run free\
<br/>
Chorus:  C   G   Em  G   D
<br/>
Where the rivers they flow with the dreams in our minds\
To the sea where all wishes and myths combine\
Where the fine yarns are woven, where the magic spins\
The eternal city, where all streets begin\
<br/>
Verse:  G   C   G   D
<br/>
In the eternal city, where dreams never die\
Where there’s only good friends and there are no goodbyes\
We’ll raise pints in our hands, and our loves we will hold\
And we’ll dance through the night to the songs in our souls\
<br/>
So here's to the nights in the places we roam\
And here’s to the cities that we call home\
With a song in our hearts, I’ll greet you on the street\
Of the eternal city, where all souls meet\
