<br/>

[Instrumental]

[VERSE 1]\
I just want to hear a fucking song,\
That makes me want to sing along,\
With my friends.\
Cause I just want to feel like I belong,\
In a world that always gets it wrong,\
Again and again.\
Just need a little country and some rock and roll,\
With the heart of old American soul,\
Amen.

[Instrumental]

[VERSE 2]\
Everything tells me what I should love,\
Silicon preachers cry from up above,\
It’s the end.\
But my tale don’t shuffle on command,\
Need a cracked-up singer and a half-lit band,\
To bend.\
So give me busted strings and a back-porch groove,\
With some rhymes that nobody need approve,\
Or defend.

[PRE-CHORUS]\
So pop all the bottles, make the floorboards shake,\
Need that ancient wisdom no code can fake.

[CHORUS]\
God damn the algorithm and blues,\
Caught in a feedback loop,\
There ain't nothin' to fix an old tune can't do,\
Give me three-chord truth,\
Drums with nothing to lose,\
Shake off the dust and let your soul shine through,\
Algorithm and blues,\
Algorithm and blues.

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]\
There’s a million little waves in the air tonight,\
Trackin’ our moves under cold blue light,\
Ain’t it grand.\
The world is lit with a counterfeit glow,\
Selling pre-mixed feelings and primetime shows,\
On demand.\
So strike up a riff and let it fan the flames,\
Watch the whole place riot and I’ll shoulder the blame,\
And the contraband.

[PRE-CHORUS]\
Light up the stage and let the speakers rip,\
I want sweat on the mic when the chorus hits.

[CHORUS]\
God damn the algorithm and blues,\
Caught in a feedback loop,\
There ain't nothin' to fix an old tune can't do,\
Give me three-chord truth,\
Drums with nothing to lose,\ 
Shake off the dust and let your soul shine through,\
Algorithm and blues,\
Algorithm and blues.

[BRIDGE]\
Drop a dollar in for the holy ghosts\
Let them howl through the amps like the heavenly host\
If the needle jumps red and we’re right on time\
It’s the roar of a soul that won't stay in line

[CHORUS]\
With the God damned algorithm and blues,\
Caught in a feedback loop,\
There ain't nothin' to fix an old tune can't do,\
Give me three-chord truth,\
Drums with nothing to lose,\ 
Shake off the dust and let your soul shine through,\
Algorithm and blues,\
Algorithm and blues.\

[Instrumental]

Algorithm and Blues,\
Algorithm and Blues,\
Algorithm and Blues,\
Algorithm and Blues.

[FADE OUT]
