<br/>

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]\
Got no silver, got no gold,\
Just a story to be told.\
Got no riches, got no crown,\
But I'll be damned if I don't get down.

[Pre-Chorus]\
You can hold me back, you can call me poor,\
But I’m rich in the feelin' that I’m livin’ for.

[Chorus]\
Ain’t got nothin’, but I'm still free,\
In every heart is a song that beats.\
Raise your hands, let the spirit breathe,\
Ain’t got nothin’, but it’s all I need.

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]\
Got no mansion, got no land,\
Just a guitar in my hand.\
Got no diamonds, got no fame,\
But I’m still standin’, I’m still in the game.

[Pre-Chorus]\
You can strip me down, you can take it all,\
But I'm still gonna rise when I hear that call.

[Chorus]\
Ain’t got nothin’, but I'm still free,\
In every heart is a song that beats.\
Raise your hands, let the spirit breathe,\
Ain’t got nothin’, but it’s all I need.

[Bridge]\
Don’t need much, just a place to dance,\
A stomp in our feet and a clap in our hands.\
The roof might shake, and the walls fall down,\
Let it out, let it out, let it shake the ground.

[Final Chorus (big and blown out)]\
Ain’t got nothin’, but I'm still free,\
In every heart is a song that beats.\
Raise your hands, let the spirit breathe,\
Ain’t got nothin’, but it’s all I need.

[Instrumental]

Ain’t got nothin’, but it’s all I need.\
Ain’t got nothin’, but it’s all I need.\
Ain’t got nothin’, but it’s all I need.\
Ain’t got nothin’, but it’s all I need.

[FADE OUT]
