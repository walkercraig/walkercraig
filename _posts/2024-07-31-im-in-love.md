[Capo 4]
[Verse Chord Progression: C  G  C  F  C  G  C]

[Verse 1]
Under a blanket of indigo
The fire dances and the shadows know
An old song plays on the radio
And I can feel your sigh
The gentle strum on an old guitar
Rolls with the wind through the trees afar
And it don’t matter where we are
I’ll never say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Take me fast or take me slow
Take me anywhere you want to go
With you anywhere feels like home
And a home can't be built on a lie
Ash to ash and dust to dust
Long ago I lost my trust
But if it’s gonna be us
Then I guess I'll be all right

[Chorus]
‘Cause I
I’m in love (4x)

[Verse 3]
Your lips feel like the breaking morn
When the world's heart beats and a new day's born  
Your hand in mine, like the first ray's warmth  
In your eyes, I see the light
We’ll tell the children of all who came before
And sing lullabies until our throats are sore
I never knew there could be more
Until you came into my life

[Verse 4]
Now let it all come undone
Go on let your holy spirit run
The battles have all been won
Now we don’t have to try
Throw your head back and hear them laughing
Wave hello to the angels passing
They've never seen a scene so full of passion
Never seen such an answer to why?

[Chorus]
‘Cause I
I’m in love (4x)

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
‘Cause I
I’m in love (4x)
