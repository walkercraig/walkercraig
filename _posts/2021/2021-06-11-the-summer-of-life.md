It's official/unofficial reopening weekend and Craig has a special message for all Chicagoans.

Good morning.<br>

It's a beautiful day, ain't it? The sun is shining. The birds are singing. A flawless breeze is dancing through my hair.<br>

Even if none of those things are actually happening the morning this is published, it'll be happening in my mind and I hope it will in yours.<br>

Because it is a beautiful day. They all are, when you think about it.<br>
