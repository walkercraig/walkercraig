[VERSE 1]\
Another day\
Another dollar\
In a way\
Feels like I’m wearin’ a collar\
And though I ain't been much\
Of a brawler\
God knows\
I can fuckin' holler

[CHORUS]\
Every once in a while\
I need to let it out like a child\
So don’t put me on trial\
If I just need to get a little wild\
So warn everyone around\
That tonight I'm going out on the town\
And just follow the sound\
Cause that’s where I'll be layin' it down\
And don't try to say\
That you can't come out to play\
Because tonight was once a someday\
Don’t you dare let it get away\
And it'll soon be a yesterday\
The type of time for which people pray\
Don't let your mind get in the way\
Let the night bring what it may

[VERSE 2]\
Some might say\
Don’t be a bother\
What are they\
They ain’t your holy father\
So if you’re rich man\
Or livin’ in squalor\
I know you need it\
Like you need water\

[CHORUS]\
Every once in a while\
Need to let it out like a child\
So don’t put us on trial\
If we just need to get a little wild\
Just warn everyone around\
That tonight we're going out on the town\
And just follow the sound\
Cause that’s where we'll be layin' it down\
And don't try to say\
That you can't come out to play\
Because tonight was once a someday\
Don’t you dare let it get away\
‘Cause it’ll soon be a yesterday\
The type of time for which people pray\
Don't let your mind get in the way\
Let the night bring what it may

[BRIDGE]\
Every once in a while (8x)

Every once in a while\
Need to let it out like a child (8x)

[CHORUS]\
Every once in a while\
Need to let it out like a child\
So don’t put us on trial\
If we just need to get a little wild\
Just warn everyone around\
That tonight we're going out on the town\
And just follow the sound\
Cause that’s where we'll be layin' it down\
And don't try to say\
That you can't come out to play\
Because tonight was once a someday\
Don’t you dare let it get away\
‘Cause it’ll soon be a yesterday\
The type of time for which people pray\
Don't let your mind get in the way\
Let the night bring what it may
