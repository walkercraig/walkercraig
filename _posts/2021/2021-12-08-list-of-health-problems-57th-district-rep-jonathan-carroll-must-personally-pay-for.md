<p>Every now and then in this life, something comes along that drags truth out of a person and gives us a proper glimpse into their true selves. The real truth, the low-down dirty and dastard truth, out from the dark corners and deep chasms buried inside.</p>

It can be anything really and it can come from anywhere. No matter what it is, it brings some real nastiness to the surface.</p>
