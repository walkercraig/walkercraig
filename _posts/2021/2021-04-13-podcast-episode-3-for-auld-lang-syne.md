title: Craig Walker Show. Episode 3. For Auld Lang Syne.
---

Since Craig first wrote this letter, he decided to turn it into an annual column. This is the original. We're excited to see the changes over the years.<br><br/>

To refresh, Craig had a song stuck in his head and needed to do what he could to stop thinking about it, so he wrote some thoughts on the classic Robert Burns poem and folk traditional song, “Auld Lang Syne.” Other topics Craig covers in this letter include the New Year holiday, Christmas, nostalgia as a sentiment and Nostalgia™ as a prescription drug, Owen Wilson and the completely ridiculous and over-the-top fantastic Michael Bay popcorn movie classic, Armageddon, and William Shakespeare.
