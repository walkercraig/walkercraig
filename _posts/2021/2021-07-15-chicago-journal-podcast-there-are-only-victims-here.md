---

<p>On this episode of the Chicago Journal podcast, Craig revisits something he wrote back in April after the Adam Toledo officer involved shooting in the Little Village neighborhood and he discusses the violence and it's relationship to the victimhood of Chicago leadership.</p>
<p>While he did update some things, unfortunately, it's over 3 months later and none of the issues show any signs of slowing down.</p>
