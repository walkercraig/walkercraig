<p>Before the whole COVID…*thing*…dominated headlines for the last 2 years, the Chicago Public School system was embroiled in a sex abuse scandal.</p>

<p>An explosive investigation by the Chicago Tribune titled "Betrayed" revealed at least a decade of under-reporting or limited action by the Chicago Public School district in cases of rape and sexual misconduct against students.[^1] The Tribune's investigation found more than 500 cases that, in many instances, the Chicago Public School District failed to prevent or did not properly handle.</p>

<p>It was scathing, to say the least.</p>
