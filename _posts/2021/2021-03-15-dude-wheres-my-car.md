title: Dude, Where's My Car?

So obtuse in their ineptitude and inability to get control of their unbelievably still growing crime problem they've long since passed so far beyond caricature that only an obscure stoner comedy from the twilight of the millenium starring Kelso and Stifler is able to fully quantify the absurdity of the condition it feels like for Craig as an audience member watching this leadership perform.

Just in time for Christmas way back in the year 2000, 20th Century Fox delivered a masterwork of the stoner comedy film genre with, Dude, Where's My Car?, that now stands as nothing short of a prophetic metaphor for life as a Chicagoan in our modern 2021. Did the writer Philip Stark, or the director Danny Leiner, know at the time that the motifs so dazzlingly explored throughout this visual exposition would prove so prescient in capturing the political and cultural landscape of early 2020s Chicago life? I won't pretend to know. Still, the film remains a veritable wonder and bonafide tour de force channeling the delicious absurdity of our age.
