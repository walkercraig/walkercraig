<br/>
On a train bound south from nowhere, with a ticket stained by tears,\
I left behind the whispers that echoed through the years.\
You stood beneath the lamplight, shadows heavy on your eyes,\
And promised you'd remember what lovers tell in lies.\
<br/>
The road was never easy, though I chased it anyhow,\
Every story I collected sounds so lonesome now.\
In towns without a name, faces blurred and unkind,\
I wandered through their silence, looking for what I'd left behind.\
<br/>
There's a cabin by the river, where we lingered in the frost,\
The walls held quiet secrets that a careless world had lost.\
Your voice, soft as a snowfall, held me captive in the gloom,\
But springtime melted quickly, leaving us in an empty room.\
<br/>
If you meet another stranger, with his future in his past,\
Tell him the road gets darker and the sunlight doesn't last.\
Tell him gently not to linger, though sweet lies may tempt him near,\
What waits behind the longing is just echoes we still hear.\
<br/>
Now I move beneath the heavens, carrying burdens, slight and strong,\
My footsteps tracing circles, trying to find where I belong.\
But nothing ever changes, no matter where I roam,\
The heart that keeps on wandering never makes it home.\
<br/>
Maybe someday I'll awaken in some distant, gentle town,\
And find that I've forgiven all the ways I've let me down.\
But until that quiet morning, when my sorrows come undone,\
I'll drift beneath the moonlight, chasing shadows of the sun.\
<br/>
And when the stars grow weary, and the night turns pale and thin,\
I'll leave another station, let another road begin.\
For the heart that's bound to wander knows that solace isn't far,\
It lives within the journey, and the longing for the stars.\
<br/>
