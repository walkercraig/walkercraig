title: It Was Good Once
---

<br/>

It was good once

I remember it well

I remember, I remember

It was enough to carry all through HÃ¦ll

<br/>

But as the flame dimmed

And shadow stretched wide

The echoes softer, distant

Like whispers of the tide

<br/>

I kept it with me

The fragile, fading light

And shared it with all

The candles in the night

<br/>

Though ash be our promise

The smoke, a guide

The memory, the strength

I carry inside

<br/>
