[Verse Chords: C  F  C  F  C  Am  G  F  G  C]

[Verse 1] 
I saw a good man lose his spark,\
His voice went quiet and his eyes went dark,\
Nothin’ left to give and nothin’ left to start,\
Just a half-sung song without heart.

[Chorus Chords:  F  C  F  C  F  C  Am  G  F  G  F  G  C]

[Chorus] 
Oh, I’m still singin’, still believin’ in a half-wrote song,\
Tryin’ to find the feelin' that can right all of the wrongs.\
Though things keep changin’, oh I keep rollin’ on,\
Oh, I’m still singin’, still believin’ in a half-wrote song. 

[Verse 2]   
I’ve worked for pay and I’ve worked for pride,\
Lost some friends I should’ve kept nearby.\
Buried some dreams that never should have died,\
And learned some truths I wish were a lie

[Chorus] 
Oh, I’m still singin’, still believin’ in a half-wrote song,\
Tryin’ to find the feelin' that can right all of the wrongs.\
Though things keep changin’, oh I keep rollin’ on,\
Oh, I’m still singin’, still believin’ in a half-wrote song. 

[Verse 3]
I've gone too far down dead end roads,\
Carried more than I could hold,\
Felt too many fires turn to ash and cold,\
But I still got some stories left untold.

[Chorus] 
Oh, I’m still singin’, still believin’ in a half-wrote song,
Tryin’ to find the feelin' that can right all of the wrongs.\
Though things keep changin’, oh I keep rollin’ on,\
Oh, I’m still singin’, still believin’ in a half-wrote song. 

[Verse 4]
I’ve watched the years bend and bow,\
The hands of time don’t slow somehow,\
The world keeps spinnin’ but I don’t know how,\
Still I’m here, and singin’ for you now.

[Chorus] 
Oh, I’m still singin’, still believin’ in a half-wrote song,\
Tryin’ to find the feelin' that can right all of the wrongs.\
Though things keep changin’, oh I keep rollin’ on,\
Oh, I’m still singin’, still believin’ in a half-wrote song. 

[Bridge] 
Maybe the point ain’t to get it right,\
Just keep on hummin' through another night,\
To carry a tune when there's no end in sight,\
And be at peace with the piece you write.

[Final Chorus] 
Oh, I’m still singin’, still believin’ in a half-wrote song,\
Tryin’ to find the feelin' that can right all of the wrongs.\
Though things keep changin’, oh I keep rollin’ on,\
Oh, I’m still singin’, still believin’ in a half-wrote song.

[Outro/Verse 5]
The river keeps moving right along,\
Some lines I missed, and some I got wrong,\
Yeah the world still turns and it just don’t seem wrong,\
To keep believin’ in a half-wrote song.
